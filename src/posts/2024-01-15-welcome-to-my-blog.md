# Welcome to My College Blog!

Hello and welcome to my new college blog! I'm excited to share this platform where I'll be documenting my journey through the TU856-4 course.

## What to Expect

This blog will serve as a space where I'll share:

- **Learning experiences** from my coursework
- **Technical tutorials** and how-to guides
- **Project showcases** and case studies
- **Reflections** on course materials and assignments
- **Resources** that I find helpful along the way

## About This Site

This blog is built using modern web technologies:

- **Eleventy (11ty)** - A powerful static site generator
- **GitHub Pages** - For reliable, free hosting
- **GitHub Actions** - For automated deployment
- **Markdown** - For easy content creation

The entire source code is available on GitHub, making it easy to track changes and improvements over time.

## Looking Forward

I'm looking forward to using this platform to not only document my learning but also to practice and improve my web development skills. Each post will be an opportunity to experiment with different content types, layouts, and features.

Stay tuned for more content as the semester progresses!
